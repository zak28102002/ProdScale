Design a premium mobile productivity app called “ProdScale” for iOS and Android.

The app uses a **black-and-white ultra-minimal interface** with modern typography, stroke-based icons, and smart AI scoring logic. The entire user experience should feel like a premium wellness app.

### 🖥️ Home (Today Screen)

- Header: App name “ProdScale” in bold, modern font
- Under it: Today’s **motivational quote** (changes daily) in italic, e.g.:
  “Discipline is remembering what you want.”

- Center: Large **circular progress meter** showing today’s **Productivity Score** (e.g., 7.8 / 10), with animated color change (white if good, red if low)

- Below: A **mascot stickman illustration** that changes expression or pose based on the score:
  - Score 9–10: Flexing or jumping
  - Score 7–8: Smiling
  - Score 4–6: Sitting tired
  - Score 1–3: Lying down or sleeping

- Activity Check-in Section:
  - List or grid of custom user-selected activities (Gym, Reading, Meditation, etc.)
  - Each shows a toggle/checkmark ✅ or ❌ for completion
  - Optional input: duration/intensity

- Reflection Box:
  - Text area for adding “Daily Notes” or thoughts
  - Adds to the AI score if filled

- Bottom Buttons:
  - “View Monthly Report” (outlined)
  - “Share Day” (filled, white button)

### 📆 Monthly Report Screen

- Calendar heatmap of scores (white for high, dark gray for low)
- Monthly average (e.g., 6.3)
- If under 6 → label: “Unproductive Month 😞”
- Monthly stickman badge (with matching mood)

### 📷 Social Sharing Screen

- Clean black card
- Shows: Daily Score, Activities Done, Quote of the Day, Stickman pose
- Add small “Made with ProdScale” logo
- Export button for Instagram, Threads, TikTok, etc.

### 🎨 Design Guidelines

- **Color Palette**: #000000 (Black), #FFFFFF (White), shades of Gray (#222, #444)
- **Fonts**: Inter, SF Pro, or Neue Montreal
- **Icons**: Lucide or stroke-based
- **Layout**: Very breathable with generous padding and minimalist cards
